# SDS Application on STMicroelectronics STM32N6570-DK board with SDSIO using USB Interface

This application is an example of using [**Edge Impulse Keyword Spotting ML algorithm**](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/547356/live) on a physical board.
It enables recording and playback of real-world data streams using physical hardware or just playback using simulation models (Arm Virtual Hardware - FVP).
The real-world data streams are captured in SDS data files.

## Pre-Requisite

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Use `cpackget add ARM::SDS` to add the SDS Framework and [Setup the SDS Python utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server).
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running the SDS Utilities.
- Complete the [STM32N6570-DK BSP FSBL_LRUN layer](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/STM32N6570-DK_BSP/blob/main/Layers/FSBL_LRUN/README.md) setup before using the SDS application project, including building the flash algorithm and FSBL outputs.

## STMicroelectronics STM32N6570-DK board

The [STMicroelectronics STM32N6570-DK](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/stmicroelectronics-stm32n6570-dk-revc-f2017e0/) board is based on a Cortex-M55 processor. For using the integrated ST-Link install the [ST-Link USB driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) or your computer and update the firmware.

## Projects

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is configured for the targets [ST STM32N6570-DK](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/stmicroelectronics-stm32n6570-dk-revc-f2017e0/guide/) or [AVH-SSE-300](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) FVP simulation models.

It contains two projects:

- **`DataTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies the SDSIO interface on hardware.
- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a Keyword Spotting ML algorithm with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board and Layer Type: SDSIO

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer. Depending on the active target that is selected, a different board layer with I/O interfaces is used:

- `Board/STM32N6570-DK/Board.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_usb.clayer.yml` use the **USB Interface** for SDS file I/O on the development board.
- `Board/Corstone-300/Board.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_fvp.clayer.yml` use the **VSI Interface** for SDS file I/O on AVH FVP simulation.

## Layer Type: Edge Impulse layer

This layer contains the ML model that is used in the `AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`.

#### ML Model update procedure

1.  **Clone the project**  
    Clone the [**Tutorial: Responding to your voice**](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/547356/live)

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugRec**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect to STLK USB connector of the ST STM32N6570-DK board and use the **`...`** menu **Target Information** to validate [ST-Link installation](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html).
4. **Load and Run** to download the application.
5. Use the VS Code **Serial Monitor** to observe the output below.

```txt
SDS I/O USB interface initialization failed or 'sdsio-server usb' unavailable!
Ensure that SDSIO-Server is running, then restart the application!
99% idle
99% idle
```

> Note:
>
> It is possible to configure the input data bandwidth by editing `SDS_ALGO_TEST_BANDWIDTH` define in the `sds_algorithm_config.h` file.
> Default bandwidth is configured to `100000U` which means approximately 100000 bytes per second.

### Recording Test

For executing the **recording** test, follow the steps below:

1. Connect a second USB cable between Host and ST STM32N6570-DK board USB-C connector.
2. Open in VS Code a Terminal Window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server usb`
3. Open the VS Code **Serial Monitor** and Start Monitoring the UART output.
4. **Load and Run** the application on the ST STM32N6570-DK board.
5. Press the **User** button on the ST STM32N6570-DK board to start recording.
6. Press the **User** button again to stop recording.

**Output of SDSIO Server**

```

**Output of Serial Monitor**

```txt
SDS recording (#0) started
98% idle
SDS recording (#0) stopped
====

99% idle
SDS recording (#1) started
```

Each run records two files: `DataInput.<n>.sds` and `DataOutput.<n>.sds` in the folder where SDSIO-Server was started. `<n>` is a sequential number.

**Check SDS Files**

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check) utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check -s DataInput.0.sds
File     : DataInput.0.sds
DataSize : 351.400 bytes
Records  : 350
BlockSize: 996 bytes
Interval : 10 ms
DataRate : 99.600 byte/s
Jitter   : 0 ms
Validation passed
```

### Playback Test

For executing the **playback** test, follow the steps below:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugPlay**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect a second USB cable between Host and ST STM32N6570-DK board STLK USB connector.
4. Open in VS Code a Terminal Window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server usb`
5. **Load and Run** the application on the ST STM32N6570-DK board hardware.
6. Press a User button on the ST STM32N6570-DK board to start playback of `DataInput` and recording of `DataOutput`.
7. Wait for playback to finish, it will finish automatically when all data from `DataInput.<n>.sds` SDS file was played back.
8. If more `DataInput` files exist repeat from step 6.

The stream `DataInput.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data. The stream `DataOutput.<m>.sds` is written whereby `<m>` is the next available file index.

> **Notes:**
>
> - The playback algorithm output data generated during playback is different then the one recorded during recording because
>   algorithm depends on data preceding the recording thus results are not identical.  
> - The playback implementation replays recordings as quickly as possible and does not account for timestamp data.
>   During playback, the ML system receives the same recorded input data, so timing information is not relevant in this context.
